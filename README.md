# Firefly_System
The Firefly System is a scratch built autopilot system built for remotely controlled aircraft by Samuel Feibel. The intention for this project is to use off the shelf sensors and hardware with custom code to provide both a functioning autopilot system as well as a test platform for forms of estimators and controllers.
